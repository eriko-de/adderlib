- page (page number to start showing results for, default = 1)
- results_per_page (number of results per page, default = 1000)
- device_id (ID of the receiver that this channel will be connected to. Recommended to ensure full checks for connection mode availability.
- filter_c_name (channel name search string)
- filter_c_description (channel description search string)
- filter_c_location (channel location search string)
- filter_favourites (set this non-empty to only show a user's favourites)

Output values:
- version - the current API version number

disabled = no, because something is in use by someone else. hidden = never. enabled = yes

this will not necessarily be an accurate indication of whether other connections may actually interfere)
