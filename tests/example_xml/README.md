Example XML Responses

The `.xml` files in this directory are examples of successful XML responses to each of the API commands, borrowed from the [official Adder documentation](https://support.adder.com/tiki/tiki-index.php?page=ALIF%3A+API#connect_preset) and intended for use with `adderlib`'s `DebugHandler` for testing purposes only.
